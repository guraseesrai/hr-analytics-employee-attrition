## üß† Advanced SQL Analysis Results

### Income Analysis by Performance

Our SQL analysis revealed compelling patterns in compensation and attrition:

**High Earners Still Leave**: Even top quartile earners (Q4) show 10.8% attrition rate
- **Primary Cause**: Role-specific stress and chronic overtime
- **Top Affected Roles**: Sales Executives, Manufacturing Directors
- **Key Factor**: 53% of high-earning leavers work regular overtime

### Age-Based Behavioral Patterns

**Why Over-50 Employees Leave More Than 40-50 Age Group**:
- Over-50 Attrition: 12.6% vs 40-50 Attrition: 10.3%
- **Root Cause**: Career stagnation - 4.6 years vs 2.6 years since last promotion
- **Recommendation**: Phased retirement programs and late-career development tracks

### Early Career Attrition Drivers (<5 Years)

**Top Factors for Early Leavers**:
1. **Overtime Burden**: 53% of early leavers work overtime regularly
2. **Work-Life Balance**: 54% rate WLB as "fair" (score 3), 25% as "poor" (score 2)
3. **Role Distribution**: Laboratory Technicians (46), Sales Representatives (30), Research Scientists (26)
